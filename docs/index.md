# Viable Systems Model Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Viable Systems Model (VSM) implementation in Elixir.

## What is VSM?

The Viable Systems Model, developed by Stafford Beer, is a model of the organizational structure of any autonomous system capable of producing itself. It provides a framework for understanding how systems maintain their identity and purpose while adapting to environmental changes.

## Key Features of Our Implementation

- **Complete VSM Implementation**: All five subsystems (S1-S5) fully implemented in Elixir
- **Algedonic Channel**: Real-time alerting system for critical signals
- **Temporal Variety Channel**: Our novel contribution to cybernetics (1,368 lines of innovative code)
- **Z3N Security Architecture**: Zero-trust, zero-knowledge, zero-latency security
- **OTP Integration**: Built on Elixir's robust OTP principles
- **Phoenix LiveView**: Real-time UI for system monitoring and control
