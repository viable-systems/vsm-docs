## VSM Architecture Integration

VSM Connections integrates seamlessly with all VSM subsystems:

### System 1 (Operations)
Provides reliable service-to-service communication for operational units:

```elixir
# Operational data exchange
{:ok, data} = VsmConnections.request(:http,
  url: "/api/operational-data",
  pool: :operations_pool,
  circuit_breaker: :operations_service
)
```

### System 2 (Coordination)
Enables coordination between operational units through messaging:

```elixir
# Coordinate between operational units
VsmConnections.redis_publish("coordination", %{
  unit: "unit_a",
  status: "ready",
  resource_allocation: 75
})
```

### System 3 (Control)
Supports monitoring and control operations with health checking:

```elixir
# Monitor and control operations
stats = VsmConnections.pool_stats()
health = VsmConnections.health_status()

# Adjust resources based on performance
if stats[:api_pool][:active] > 8 do
  VsmConnections.Pool.update_pool(:api_pool, %{size: 15})
end
```

### System 4 (Intelligence)
Facilitates environmental scanning and intelligence gathering:

```elixir
# Environmental scanning via gRPC
{:ok, market_data} = VsmConnections.request(:grpc,
  service: IntelligenceService.Stub,
  method: :get_market_trends,
  circuit_breaker: :intelligence_service
)
```

### System 5 (Policy)
Supports policy coordination and governance communications.

### Algedonic Channels
Implements emergency communication pathways for critical alerts:

```elixir
# Emergency communication pathways
VsmConnections.redis_subscribe("algedonic:emergency", fn alert ->
  case alert.severity do
    :critical -> 
      # Immediate escalation to System 5
      VsmConnections.redis_publish("system5:alerts", alert)
    _ -> 
      :ok
  end
end)
```

## Installation

Add `vsm_connections` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:vsm_connections, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Quick Start

```elixir
# Start the VSM Connections infrastructure
{:ok, _} = VsmConnections.start()

# Make an HTTP request with circuit breaker protection
{:ok, response} = VsmConnections.request(:http, 
  url: "https://api.example.com/users",
  method: :get,
  circuit_breaker: :api_service
)

# Check service health
:ok = VsmConnections.health_check(:api_service)

# Use Redis for distributed state
:ok = VsmConnections.redis_set("user:123", %{name: "John"})
{:ok, user} = VsmConnections.redis_get("user:123")
```

## Configuration

Configure VSM Connections in your `config.exs`:

```elixir
config :vsm_connections,
  # Connection pools
  pools: %{
    api_pool: %{
      protocol: :http,
      host: "api.example.com",
      port: 443,
      scheme: :https,
      size: 10,
      timeout: 5_000
    }
  },
  
  # Circuit breakers
  circuit_breakers: %{
    api_service: %{
      failure_threshold: 5,
      recovery_timeout: 60_000,
      call_timeout: 5_000
    }
  },
  
  # Health checks
  health_checks: %{
    api_service: %{
      url: "https://api.example.com/health",
      interval: 30_000,
      timeout: 5_000
    }
  },
  
  # Redis configuration
  redis: %{
    url: "redis://localhost:6379",
    pool_size: 10
  }
```

## Protocol Adapters

### HTTP/HTTPS
```elixir
# Simple GET request
{:ok, response} = VsmConnections.Adapters.HTTP.get("https://api.example.com/users")

# POST with JSON body
{:ok, response} = VsmConnections.Adapters.HTTP.post(
  "https://api.example.com/users",
  %{name: "John", email: "john@example.com"},
  headers: [{"content-type", "application/json"}]
)
```

### WebSockets
```elixir
# Connect to WebSocket
{:ok, socket} = VsmConnections.Adapters.WebSocket.connect(
  url: "wss://api.example.com/socket",
  callback_module: MyApp.SocketHandler
)

# Send message
:ok = VsmConnections.Adapters.WebSocket.send_message(socket, %{
  type: "subscribe",
  channel: "user_updates"
})
```

### gRPC
```elixir
# Connect to gRPC service
{:ok, channel} = VsmConnections.Adapters.GRPC.connect(
  host: "api.example.com",
  port: 443,
  scheme: :https
)

# Make unary call
{:ok, response} = VsmConnections.Adapters.GRPC.call(
  service: UserService.Stub,
  method: :get_user,
  message: %GetUserRequest{id: 123},
  channel: channel
)
```

## Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers provide automatic failure detection and recovery:

```elixir
# Automatic failure handling
{:ok, result} = VsmConnections.CircuitBreaker.call(:api_service, fn ->
  make_api_call()
end)

# Monitor circuit breaker state
:closed = VsmConnections.CircuitBreaker.get_state(:api_service)

# Manual control
:ok = VsmConnections.CircuitBreaker.open(:api_service)
:ok = VsmConnections.CircuitBreaker.close(:api_service)
```

## Health Monitoring

Automated health checking for all services:

```elixir
# Check specific service
:ok = VsmConnections.HealthCheck.check(:api_service)

# Get all service statuses
%{
  api_service: :healthy,
  database: :unhealthy,
  cache: :healthy
} = VsmConnections.HealthCheck.get_all_status()
```

## Fault Tolerance

Comprehensive retry and backoff mechanisms:

```elixir
# Retry with exponential backoff
{:ok, result} = VsmConnections.with_retry(fn ->
  risky_operation()
end, 
  max_attempts: 5,
  base_delay: 200,
  backoff_strategy: :exponential
)

# Deadline management
{:ok, result} = VsmConnections.FaultTolerance.with_deadline(fn ->
  slow_operation()
end, 5_000)
```

## Redis Integration

Distributed state management and messaging:

```elixir
# Key-value operations
:ok = VsmConnections.redis_set("user:123", %{name: "John"})
{:ok, user} = VsmConnections.redis_get("user:123")

# Pub/Sub messaging
:ok = VsmConnections.redis_publish("events", %{type: "user_created"})

{:ok, subscription} = VsmConnections.redis_subscribe("events", fn message ->
  handle_event(message)
end)

# Transactions
{:ok, results} = VsmConnections.Redis.transaction(fn ->
  VsmConnections.Redis.set("key1", "value1")
  VsmConnections.Redis.set("key2", "value2")
end)
```
